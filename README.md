## Introduction

Welcome! This comprehensive guide provides a universal process for preparing your own speech datasets and training a custom Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. Whether you have a small dataset (e.g., 10 hours) or a larger one (100+ hours), these steps will help you organize your data correctly and navigate the training process for most modern TTS frameworks.

**Goal:** To empower you to fine-tune or train a TTS model on a specific voice or language using your own audio-text pairs.

**What This Guide Covers:**
This guide is split into several parts, covering the entire workflow from planning to using your trained model:

1.  **Planning:** Initial considerations before starting your project.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Acquiring, processing, and structuring audio and text data.
3.  **Training Setup:** Preparing your environment and configuring the training parameters.
4.  **Model Training:** Launching, monitoring, and fine-tuning the TTS model.
5.  **Inference:** Using your trained model to synthesize speech.
6.  **Packaging & Sharing:** Organizing and documenting your model for future use or distribution.
7.  **Troubleshooting & Resources:** Common issues and helpful tools.

## 0. Before You Start: Planning Your Dataset

Before collecting data, consider these crucial points to ensure your project is well-defined and achievable:

1.  **Speaker:** Will it be a single speaker or multiple speakers? Single-speaker datasets are simpler to start with for fine-tuning or initial training. Multi-speaker models require careful data balancing and speaker ID management.
2.  **Data Source:** Where will you get the audio? (Audiobooks, podcasts, radio archives, professionally recorded voice data, your own recordings). **Crucially, ensure you have the necessary rights or licenses to use the data for training models.**
3.  **Audio Quality:** Aim for the highest quality possible. Prioritize clean recordings with minimal background noise, reverb, music, or overlapping speech. Consistency in recording conditions is highly beneficial.
4.  **Language & Domain:** What language(s) will the model speak? What is the speaking style or domain (e.g., narration, conversational, news reading)? The model will perform best on text similar to its training data.
5.  **Target Data Amount:** How much data do you plan to collect or use?
    *   **~1-5 hours:** Might be sufficient for basic voice *cloning* if using a strong pre-trained model, but quality might be limited.
    *   **~5-20 hours:** Generally considered the minimum for decent *fine-tuning* of a specific voice onto a pre-trained model.
    *   **50-100+ hours:** Better for training robust models or training models with less reliance on pre-trained weights, especially for less common languages.
    *   **1000+ hours:** Needed for training high-quality, general-purpose models largely from scratch.
6.  **Sampling Rate:** Decide on a target sampling rate (e.g., 16000 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz) early on. Higher rates capture more detail but require more storage and compute. **All your training data MUST consistently use the chosen rate.** 22050 Hz is a common balance for many TTS models.

## Glossary of Technical Terms

This glossary explains key technical terms used throughout the guides to help newcomers understand the terminology:

- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: Technology that converts spoken language into written text; used for transcribing audio data.
- **Batch Size**: The number of training examples processed together in one forward/backward pass; affects training speed and memory usage.
- **Checkpoint**: A saved snapshot of a model's weights during or after training, allowing you to resume training or use the model for inference.
- **CUDA**: NVIDIA's parallel computing platform that enables GPU acceleration for deep learning tasks.
- **dBFS (Decibels relative to Full Scale)**: A unit of measurement for audio levels in digital systems, where 0 dBFS represents the maximum possible level.
- **Diffusion Models**: A class of generative models that gradually add and then remove noise from data; some recent TTS systems use this approach.
- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: An algorithm that converts time-domain signals to frequency-domain representations; fundamental for audio processing.
- **Fine-tuning**: The process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt it to a new voice or language.
- **LUFS (Loudness Units relative to Full Scale)**: A standardized measurement of perceived loudness, more representative of human hearing than peak measurements.
- **Manifest File**: A text file that lists audio files and their corresponding transcriptions, used to tell the training script where to find the data.
- **Mel Spectrogram**: A visual representation of audio that approximates human auditory perception by using the mel scale; commonly used as an intermediate representation in TTS systems.
- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new data.
- **Sampling Rate**: The number of audio samples per second (measured in Hz); higher rates capture more audio detail but require more storage and processing power.
- **STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)**: A technique that determines the frequency content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Technology that converts written text into spoken voice output.
- **Validation Loss**: A metric that measures the error of a model on a validation dataset (data not used for training); helps detect overfitting.
- **VRAM (Video RAM)**: Memory on a graphics card; deep learning models and their intermediate calculations are stored here during training.
- **Vocoder**: A component in some TTS systems that converts acoustic features (like mel spectrograms) into waveforms (actual audio).
