# Universal TTS Model Training & Dataset Preparation Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! This comprehensive guide provides a universal process for preparing your own speech datasets and training a custom Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. Whether you have a small dataset (e.g., 10 hours) or a larger one (100+ hours), these steps will help you organize your data correctly and navigate the training process for most modern TTS frameworks.

**Goal:** To empower you to fine-tune or train a TTS model on a specific voice or language using your own audio-text pairs.

**What This Guide Covers:**
This guide is split into several parts, covering the entire workflow from planning to using your trained model:

1.  **Planning:** Initial considerations before starting your project.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Acquiring, processing, and structuring audio and text data.
3.  **Training Setup:** Preparing your environment and configuring the training parameters.
4.  **Model Training:** Launching, monitoring, and fine-tuning the TTS model.
5.  **Inference:** Using your trained model to synthesize speech.
6.  **Packaging & Sharing:** Organizing and documenting your model for future use or distribution.
7.  **Troubleshooting & Resources:** Common issues and helpful tools.

## 0. Before You Start: Planning Your Dataset

Before collecting data, consider these crucial points to ensure your project is well-defined and achievable:

1.  **Speaker:** Will it be a single speaker or multiple speakers? Single-speaker datasets are simpler to start with for fine-tuning or initial training. Multi-speaker models require careful data balancing and speaker ID management.
2.  **Data Source:** Where will you get the audio? (Audiobooks, podcasts, radio archives, professionally recorded voice data, your own recordings). **Crucially, ensure you have the necessary rights or licenses to use the data for training models.**
3.  **Audio Quality:** Aim for the highest quality possible. Prioritize clean recordings with minimal background noise, reverb, music, or overlapping speech. Consistency in recording conditions is highly beneficial.
4.  **Language & Domain:** What language(s) will the model speak? What is the speaking style or domain (e.g., narration, conversational, news reading)? The model will perform best on text similar to its training data.
5.  **Target Data Amount:** How much data do you plan to collect or use?
    *   **~1-5 hours:** Might be sufficient for basic voice *cloning* if using a strong pre-trained model, but quality might be limited.
    *   **~5-20 hours:** Generally considered the minimum for decent *fine-tuning* of a specific voice onto a pre-trained model.
    *   **50-100+ hours:** Better for training robust models or training models with less reliance on pre-trained weights, especially for less common languages.
    *   **1000+ hours:** Needed for training high-quality, general-purpose models largely from scratch.
6.  **Sampling Rate:** Decide on a target sampling rate (e.g., 16000 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz) early on. Higher rates capture more detail but require more storage and compute. **All your training data MUST consistently use the chosen rate.** 22050 Hz is a common balance for many TTS models.
